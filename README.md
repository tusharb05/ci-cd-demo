![CI/CD Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x400.png?text=CI%2FCD+Pipeline+Banner)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a streamlined CI/CD pipeline for a Python application using GitHub Actions. It emphasizes code quality through linting and formatting checks and automates the deployment of static documentation to GitHub Pages upon merging to the `main` branch.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11**
- **GitHub Actions**
- **Flake8** for linting
- **Black** for code formatting
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting static content

1. **Continuous Integration (CI):**

   - Triggered on every `push` or `pull_request`.
   - Sets up Python environment.
   - Installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
   - Runs linting and formatting checks.

2. **Continuous Deployment (CD):**
   - Triggered on push to `main`.
   - Validates the presence of `docs/index.html`.
   - Deploys the `docs/` directory to GitHub Pages.
   - Sends a notification upon successful deployment.
